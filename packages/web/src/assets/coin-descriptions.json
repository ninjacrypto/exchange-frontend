The value imbued into each unit of the currency from the folding network it represents would add additional traction and inertia to the coin’s trading value.

If the reward schedule drops too quickly, the founders or early adopters hold all the existing coin and there is little incentive for new miners to secure the network - stagnation. Transaction fees do provide incentive for miners but high fees can also drag down the value of the coin. On the other hand, if a reward schedule drops too slowly, the supply increases without bound and inflation is the result. Woodcoin’s coinbase reward finds the middle ground between stagnation and inflation by growing logarithmically. This means that the mining reward is always bigger today than it will be tomorrow, and that there will aways be a significant reward incentive for miners to secure the network. The logarithmic money supply policy is designed for stability and longevity. Half the LOGs will be released in the first 200 years, instead of the first 4 years (as BTC or LTC).",
